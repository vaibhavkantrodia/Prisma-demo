## Using Prisma Without Migrations

Yes, you can run Prisma without migrations, but you still need to **generate the Prisma client** to make sure your NestJS app can interact with the MySQL database.

If you **don't** want to run migrations (`npx prisma migrate dev`), you have two options:

---

âœ” Installed Prisma Client:

```sh
npm install @prisma/client
```

### **âœ… Option 1: Use `prisma db push` Instead of Migrations**
If you want to sync your schema without using migrations, run:

```sh
npx prisma db push
```

This command **updates the MySQL database to match your Prisma schema** without creating a migration history. It's useful for **development environments**.

---

### **âœ… Option 2: Just Regenerate Prisma Client**
If your database schema is already correct, you can **skip `db push` and migrations**. Just run:

```sh
npx prisma generate
```

This will regenerate the Prisma client **without modifying the database**.

---

### **ðŸš€ Final Steps**
After running **either** `prisma db push` or `prisma generate`, restart your NestJS app:

```sh
npm run start:dev
```

Your app should now work with **MySQL** without running migrations. ðŸŽ¯
